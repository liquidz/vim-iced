=== Expand expanded macro

As you know, {help_html}#%3AIcedMacroExpand1OuterList[IcedMacroExpand1OuterList] will show the result of expanding *once*.

In the separated buffer for expanding macro, you can use `IcedMacroExpand1OuterList` command and its `{plug_iced_macroexpand_1_outer_list}` key mapping again.
This means you can expand the expanded macro additionally.
